        "1. Identify as many signals as you can. Watch out! These are real data, and so glitches may be present. Any correct detection is +1 point but any false alarms will count -1 point against your score. For each signal you find, list:\n",
        "  - the merger time;\n",
        "  - the SNR;\n",
        "  - your estimate of the component masses.\n",
        "2. Identify as many glitches as you can. Make a spectrogram of each one.\n",
        "3. For each simulated BBH you found, use bilby to compute a posterior distribution for the mass. You can fix the spin and mass ratio to make this run faster.\n",
